## Welcome to my page! 
My name is Ella Fino and I'm a junior studying journalism at Lehigh University. 
I created this repository for a project in my data journalism class with Professor Jia. 


## Lehigh Undergraduate Residence Data

Here is an undergraduate residence infographic I created using Canva. As you can see, the highest percentage of Lehigh students live in residence halls. The second biggest percentage live in off-campus residences. The final two percentages account for Greek life; those who live in sorority and fraternity chapter houses.
